# autoglot
A web app to auto generate conference titles using Machine Learning techniques

* The data comes from the [CascoNet Conference Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09485) paper generated by Dixin Luo, Kelly Lyons.
We are using the Conference Topic data set.
* The topic types are pulled from the common formats outlined in the [Enviromental Evaulators Network](http://www.environmentalevaluators.net/ideas-for-designing-and-leading-sessions/)
